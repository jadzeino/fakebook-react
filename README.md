# FakeBook
FakeBook is a full-stack clone of the popular social media platform, Facebook. It provides all the core features you'd expect from a social media platform, such as user authentication, friend requests, timeline posts, media uploads, and real-time messaging. The project uses Node.js and Express for the backend API, MongoDB for data storage, and React for the frontend with hooks and functional components.
